Tarumba is a frontend for multiple archive managers. It aims to provide a
simple unified interface to manage all your archives. Tarumba is also a Python
library for archive manager integration.

Tarumba cannot handle any archives by itself. Instead, it uses the archive
managers available on the system. See the list of supported backends below.

## Usage

The basic usage of Tarumba is:

```console
tarumba action [options] archive [files...]
```

Archive is the path to the archive that you want to manage.

Files are the paths to the files used in the action.

There are 6 available actions, you can enter the word or only the first letter.

- (l) list  
  Lists files in the archive. You can enter an optional list of files to list
  only those files.
- (a) add  
  Adds files to the archive. The list of files is mandatory, a new archive will
  be created if it doesn't exist.
- (e) extract (e)  
  Extract files from the archive. The list of files is optional, when absent all
  the files in the archive will be extracted.
- (d) delete  
  Deletes files from the archive. The list of files is mandatory.
- (t) test  
  Tests the archive integrity. With some archive formats, you can enter an
  optional list of files to check only those files.
- (r) rename  
  Renames files in the archive. It is mandatory to enter pairs of files and
  every par will be interpreted as the old and new file paths.
